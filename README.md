# Predict LA Crime
This repository contains Python code to train a deep learning model (fully-connected neural network) (implemented with Keras) to predict the probabilities of being a victim of different types of crime based on the month, time of day, age, sex, descent, and location within LA.\
\
To train the deep learning model, run:\
`python model.py`\
*(Trained neural network parameters will be stored in `model.h5`)*

**Note: The files take a little while to run because they pull data straight from the dataset host, via the Soda API.**
